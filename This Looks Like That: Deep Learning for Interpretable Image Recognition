# Reading Notes on "This Looks Like That: Deep Learning for Interpretable Image Recognition"

## Abstract
- **Objective**: Introduces the ProtoPNet, a deep network architecture for interpretable image classification.
- **Method**: Combines case-based reasoning with image dissection using prototypes, leading to human-like reasoning in classification.
- **Results**: Achieves comparable accuracy to non-interpretable models and provides a high level of interpretability.

## Introduction
- **Challenge**: Making deep learning interpretable, similar to human reasoning in classifying images.
- **Solution**: The ProtoPNet, which dissects images to find prototypical parts and combines evidence for final classification.

## Methods
- **Architecture**: ProtoPNet combines convolutional layers with a prototype layer and a fully connected layer.
- **Training**: The network learns prototypes that are latent representations of image parts, used for comparison and classification.

## Experiments
- **Datasets**: Applied to bird species and car model identification.
- **Findings**: Comparable accuracy with non-interpretable counterparts; increased interpretability.

## Conclusion
- **Impact**: ProtoPNet provides an interpretable form of deep learning, maintaining accuracy while offering human-like reasoning in image classification.
